# Machine learning for League of Legends winner prediction

Our goal is to use machine learning for predicting winners of League of Legends matches. League of Legends is a multiplayer game that combines elements from strategic and action games. Every year, multiple professional
League of Legends competitions are being held acros the globe. We try to
predict both professional and non-professional matches. Getting data for
both types of matches is already a challenge. For non-professional matches
official application programming interface is used, while data for professional
matches is gathered using web scraping. We begin our research by using the
collected data for initial analysis, where we compare player statistics from
different ranks. We find some interesting differences that lower-ranked players could use to improve their game without huge amount of effort. After
that, we use standard machine learning approaches to predict match winners.
Classificators for non-professional matches yield similar results to a recently
published study. We also compare the results for both types of matches and
find that it is easier to predict the outcomes of professional matches.
